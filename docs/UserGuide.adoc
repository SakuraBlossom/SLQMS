== Introduction

ClerkPro is an appointment and queue management system targeted at clerks working in small clinics.
This desktop application is optimised for individuals who *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI).*
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

ClerkPro enables clerks to rapidly manage patient's details, appointments, queues and the staff's duty roster.
Typing fast allows you to complete your tasks much faster than GUI apps.

Interested? Refer to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ClerkPro.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for ClerkPro.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The User Interface (UI) should appear in a few seconds. For testing purposes, ClerkPro is pre-loaded with sample data to allow you to explore and familiarise with the application.
+

+
. You may navigate through the entire UI with kbd:[UP], kbd:[DOWN], kbd:[LEFT], kbd:[RIGHT] and kbd:[TAB].
. The figure below shows the layout.
+

+
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing `help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. Alternatively, just press kbd:[F1].
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `newpatient -id E0000001A -name John Doe -phone 98765432 -email johnd@example.com -address John street, block 123, #01-01` : registers a patient named `John Doe`.
* `patient John Doe` : searches for a patient whose name contains `John Doe`
* `enqueue E0000001A` : enqueues patient with reference id `E0000001A` into the queue. The patient `E0000001A` must be registered.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

Do not directly edit any of the  following json files: e.g. `appointments.json`, `dutyRoster.json`, `patientDetails.json`, `staffDetails.json`, `preferences.json`, `config.json`

== Features

====
*AutoComplete & History*

* When the command box is blank, kbd:[UP] & kbd:[DOWN] will auto-fill the command box with commands previously entered. kbd:[UP] gives older commands and kbd:[DOWN] gives newer commands.

* When the command box is not blank, AutoComplete will come into action and tries to suggest commands that are available for whatever that has been typed. During which, you may traverse your selection of the suggestions via kbd:[UP] & kbd:[DOWN] then press kbd:[ENTER] to confirm selection.

*Full keyboard navigable UI*

* kbd:[LEFT] & kbd:[RIGHT] changes focus between OmniPanel and TabBar when focus is not on CommandBox.

* kbd:[TAB] changes focus from TabBar/OmniPanel to CommandBox and from CommandBox to TabBar.

====
*Reactive search*

* The listing automatically filters to display only the most relevant results when searching for an existing entry.

* When searching for a specific patient or staff, using the `patient` or `doctor` command, the results are filtered based
    on whether the person's reference Id, name or phone number contains the given keyword.

* When searching for a specific appointment or duty shift, using the `appointments` or `shifts` command, the results are filtered based
    on whether the events involves a person whose reference Id contains the given keyword.

*Validity of Appointment's timings*

* Ensures that appointments can only be scheduled at timings when there are sufficient staffing.

* The scheduling of a patient's appointment will be rejected by the system, if the doctors on-duty at that timing are already
    pre-occupied by other appointments.

* The cancellation or changing of a doctor's duty shift will be rejected by the system, if the action results in there being
    insufficient staffing to accommodate already scheduled appointments.

*Command Format*

* Words in `<UPPER_CASE>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `register -name <NAME>`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `register -name John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `-name <NAME> [-tag <TAG>]` can be used as `-name John Doe -tag friend` or as `-name John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[-tag <TAG>]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `-tag friend`, `-tag friend -tag family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `-name <NAME> -phone <PHONE_NUMBER>`, `-phone <PHONE_NUMBER> -name <NAME>` is also acceptable.

* A Reference Id refers to a 9 case-insensitive alphanumeric characters, that can be used to uniquely identify a person, such as a membership number or NRIC.

* A `<PATIENT_REFERENCE_ID>` refers to the reference id which belongs to a patient. Whereas, a `<STAFF_REFERENCE_ID>` refers to the reference id of a staff doctor.

* Words in triangle brackets(`<` and `>`) are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `register -name <NAME>`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `register -name John Doe`.

IMPORTANT: All timings are based on the system's clock.
