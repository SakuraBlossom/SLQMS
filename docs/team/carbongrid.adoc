It is written in Java, and has about 17 kLoC (cross verified at https://codetabs.com/count-loc/count-loc-online.html & http://line-count.herokuapp.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T09-3/main).

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement (Largest Contribution): Major Rework on User Interface (UI) with AutoComplete with flags.*
** What it does: Reduces the mental workload & visual fatigue of user from having to carefully type commands and double checking the typed command or the user guide for supported commands and parameters.
** Justification: Enhances user experience (UX) design significantly because it provides optimal focus on primary tasks at hand to reduce visual and cognitive expenditure.
** Highlights: Affects interaction against existing UI components as the traversal have to be critically handled from component to component.
** Credits: None

* *Major enhancement: Reactive Search (Proposal & UX Concept)*
** What it does: Gives the user an instant preview of the search result. Prevents UI from locking up upon time-consuming processing.
** Justification: Enhances UX significantly as user no longer have to wait for application to completely finish searching before giving new inputs.
** Highlights: Requires understanding the process of JavaFX main application thread and plan to defer updates in a way that is not disruptive to UX of other components.
** Credits: SakuraBlossom (Threading and Logic), Google & Chrome DevTools Console (Inspiration)

* *Minor enhancement*: added history for the CLI that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
