== Introduction
This project portfolio briefly introduces the project, ClerkPro and outlines my contributions to the project's key features.

=== About the Team

My team consists of 4 year 2 Computer Science Undergraduate students, including myself.

=== About the Project: ClerkPro

ClerkPro is a desktop application used for appointments scheduling and queue management system targeted at clerks working in small clinics.
Our application is optimised for individuals who *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)*
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This symbol indicates extra information or definition.

`Model` :
Text with this font and grey highlight indicates a component, class or object in the architecture of
the application. It also indicates a generic command format for the command box in the User Guide.

[blue]`command` :
Text with this blue font and grey highlight indicates a command that can be inputted by the user.

=== Introduction to ClerkPro

This desktop application consists of 4 tabs, a right side panel to display the patients currently being served,
a command box for users to input their commands and a response box.
Each tab serves a different purpose, but are designed to facilitate an effortless experience in managing the
scheduling of appointments for patients.

The following shows the various tabs and their respective purposes (from top to bottom):

    . Patient tab: Keeps track of patient particulars.
    . Appointments tab: Handles the scheduling of patients' appointments
    . Staff tab: Keeps track of particulars of staff doctors.
    . Duty Shift tab: Records the shift timings of which doctor is on duty.

== Summary of contributions

My responsibilities includes management of patient particulars and morphing the backend of the application
to support the its appointment management features. This section will describe my contributions in greater detail.

* *Major enhancement*: Implementation of *Reactive Search (Multi-Threading and Logic)*
** What it does: As the user types, an instant preview of search results is provided.
This feature is used to search for registered patients, appointments, doctors and duty shifts.
** Justification: Enhances user experience (UX) significantly as the system is able to narrow down search
search results as the user is giving new inputs.
** Highlights: Requires understanding the process of JavaFX main application thread and plan to defer updates in a way that is not disruptive to UX of other components.
** Credits: Daniel Tan Jun Xian (team member for the proposal of the UX concept)

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: Allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: Provide a convenient way to rectify any mistakes made by the user.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Major enhancement*: *prevents over scheduling of appointments*
** What it does: Ensures that user do not mistakenly schedule more patient appointments than available on-duty doctors at any given appointment of time.
** Justification: This feature assists the user to avoid mistakenly over scheduling appointments for patients.
** Highlights: This same functionality can be used to determine the number of doctors on-duty during a given timing.

* *Minor enhancement*: Patients and doctors can be identified using a unique reference id.

* *Minor enhancement*: Modified fields to be optional for patients and doctors. These optional fields include phone number, home address and email.
