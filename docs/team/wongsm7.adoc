== PROJECT: ClerkPro

---

== Overview

ClerkPro is a desktop application used for managing clinic's appointments, queue and scheduling. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement 1*: added *the ability to enqueue/dequeue patients into the queue*
** What it does: allows the user to add patients into the queue based on the `referenceId` of the patient. It also allows the user to remove patients from the queue based on the index number.
** Justification: This feature has high priority as the user (clerk/receptionist) would need to add or remove patients from the queue.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Major enhancement 2*: added *the ability to serve patients and assign them to a doctor*
** What it does: serves the first patient in the queue and assigns them to a doctor based on the index number.
** Justification: This feature is important as the user (clerk/receptionist) would need to assign patients in the queue to doctors.

* *Major enhancement 3*: added *the ability to keep track of doctors on duty*
** What it does: allows the user to be able to know how many doctors are on duty. Also, allows the user to know if any doctors went for a break.
** Justification: This feature is useful as it allows the user (clerk/receptionist) to know how many doctors are on duty and is able to assign patients to them.

* *Minor enhancement*: added compatibility with the undo/redo commands
