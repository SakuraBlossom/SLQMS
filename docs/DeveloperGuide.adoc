== Introduction

ClerkPro is an appointment and queue management system targeted at clerks working in small clinics.
This developer guide is organised in a top-down approach, beginning with the Architecture Design.
You may jump to any section by clicking on the heading in the contents page.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of ClerkPro. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `OmniPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `SystemCommandParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
    * A `Command` object can be classified as one of two types, a `ReversibleCommand` and a `NonActionableCommand`.
    * A `ReversibleCommand` refers to any command which modifies the data in the system's model.
        To enable the user to revert their changes, the actions of such commands needs to be reversible.
    * Conversely, a `NonActionableCommand` only reads data from the system's model without modifying it.

.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient).
    *  If the user intends to execute a reversible command, a `ReversibleActionPairCommand` is created and pushed into an undo stack.
        This action pair command contains a pairing of of the action itself and its inverse.
        (e.g. Pairing 'add person A' and 'delete person A' command).
    *  If the user intends to execute a `NonActionableCommand`, the command will be directly executed.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

. Handles the mutli-threading of reactive search requests by the user.
    * When the user is searching for an existing entry, the system will attempt to filter through the results as the user types.

    * Each key stroke will trigger a new reactive search request which is processed on a separate thread.
        This is done to avoid lagging the UI.

    * If a new reactive search request is triggered before the previous request has been completed.
        The previous request thread will be interrupted before the new request thread is allowed to be executed.

    * The execution of a reactive search differs from the normal command, in the way that it only allows the execution of `NonActionableCommand` types.
        Hence, there is no modification of any data in the system's model when executing a reactive search.

// tag::queueuml[]

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `enqueue E0000001A` API call.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelOverviewClassDiagramV3.png[]
// end::queueuml[]
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

==== Overall Model component
The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.

* does not depend on any of the other three components: `Logic`, `Ui`, and `Storage`.

* consists of 3 sub-components: `QueueManager`, `AddressBook` and `AppointmentBook`.

* stores the details of patients and staff in 2 separate instances of `AddressBook`.

* stores the patients' appointments and duty shifts of staff doctors in 2 separate instances of `Appointment Book.

* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

* stores a unique list of `Tags` and `ReferenceId`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.

The `QueueManager`,

* stores a `QueueList` object that represents the queue.
* stores a `UniqueElementList<Room>` which represents a list of consultation rooms where staff doctors are stationed.


The `AddressBook`,

* stores a `Person` object that, depending on its usage, can represent either a staff doctor or patients.
* stores a `UniquePersonList` which represents a list of all registered doctors or patients.


The `AppointmentBook`,

* stores a `Event` object that, depending on its usage, can represent either a patient's appointment and staff duty shift.
* stores a `UniquePersonList` which represents a list of all registered appointments or shifts.



// tag::storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagramV2.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* saves `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* saves and read data of the particulars of patients and doctors in json format.
* saves and read data of the Appointments and duty shifts data in json format.
* reuses `JsonAddressBookStorage` to store the details of doctors and patients.
* reuses `JsonAppointmentBookStorage` to store the details of staff duty shifts and patient's appointments.

// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Unique Reference Identification

In ClerkPro, each person is assigned a unique `ReferenceId`.
    Appointments and duty shifts are tagged to the respective patients and doctors through the use of `ReferenceId`.

This unique reference identifier consist of two parts:

    . a unique case-insensitive string, which consist of 9 alphanumeric characters, referring to its unique ID
    . a boolean referring to whether the reference identifier belonged to a person who is registered as a patient or a staff doctor.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature

The undo/redo feature allows users to revert the action of a command or redo a command action that has been undone.

==== Current Implementation

We use a pairing of two commands to describe any action that can be undone.
This pairing is encapsulated as a `ReversibleActionPairCommand`, which consists of the command to be executed and its inverse.

Consider that our appointment management system provides the user the ability to
add, delete and reschedule an appointment using the commands named
`AddApptCommand`, `CancelApptCommand`, `EditApptCommand` respectively.

The implementation of the undo feature of
the `AddApptCommand` which schedules a new appointment for a given patient,
would be the equivalent of cancelling the newly added appointment. By invoking its inverse
command, `CancelApptCommand`, we can mimic the undo functionality of `AddApptCommand`.

Unlike implementing the undo functionality into every command that modifies the database of our system,
we can mimic these undo functionality by pairing and executing existing commands which are available to us.


With such an implementation, our design can conform to the Command pattern without violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
Moreover, this implementation is less likely to face performance issues in terms of memory usage, compared to the Memento Pattern,
which implements the undo capability by storing an instance of every previous state of the application in memory.


The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

.Commit Activity Diagram
image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]






A Command can be classified as one of two types, a `ReversibleCommand` or `NonActionableCommand`.
A `ReversibleCommand` refers to any command which modifies the data stored by the system.
Conversely, a `NonActionableCommand` only reads data from the system's model without modifying it.

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by the `CommandHistory` class, which is found in the `logic` component.
The history class stores commands that can be undone as a `ReversibleActionPairCommand`,
which describes a pairing of two `ReversibleActionCommand`, the first command being the action to be executed and its inverse.
(e.g. Pairing 'add event A' and 'delete event A' command).


//TODO: insert class diagram



The design of `CommandHistory` uses the Command pattern, a common design pattern often used in software engineering.
It implements the following operations:

* `CommandHistory#addToCommandHistory()` -- Saves the most recent command that modifies the system's model in its undo history.
* `CommandHistory#performUndo()` -- Performs the inverse operation to restore the system to its previous state.
* `CommandHistory#performRedo()` -- Restores a previously undone state by re-executing the respective undone command.
* `CommandHistory#canUndo()` -- Checks if there are previous states to be restored
* `CommandHistory#canRedo()` -- Checks if the a previously undone state can be restored

These operations are all contained within the `Logic` component and do not depend on any other components.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `CommandHistory` will be initialised with an empty undo and redo stack.

Step 2. The user executes `newpatient ... -name Mark` command which registers a new patient named `Mark` with the unique id of `S9729970A`.
The `newpatient` command creates a `ReversibleActionPairCommand`, which pairs of a `RegisterPatientCommand` and `UnregisterPatientCommand`.
After the invoking execution of the `RegisterPatientCommand`, the whole `ReversibleActionPairCommand` is pushed to the undo history stack
via the `CommandHistory#addToCommandHistory()`

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `enqueue S9729970A` command to add a patient whose reference id matches `S9729970A`.
    The `enqueue` command also calls the `CommandHistory#addToCommandHistory()`, which pushes the enqueue action pair into the command history stack.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 4. The user executes `newpatient ... -name John Doe` to register a new patient. Similar to the previous command, also causes another action pair to be added into the command history undo stack.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `CommandHistory#performRedo()`. Hence, the command will not be saved into the command history.

Step 5. The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `CommandHistory#performUndo()`.
This invokes the `UnregisterPatientCommand` which reverts the system to its previous state,
and moves the action from the top undo stack to the top of the redo history stack.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the undo stack is empty then there are no previous states to be restored. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Undo Sequence Diagram
image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `CommandHistory#performRedo()` which restores the address book to that state by invoking the original command again.

[NOTE]
If the `commandRedoHistory` is empty, then there are no undone states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `patient S9482963D`.
A command that searches for a patient whose id matches `S9482963D`,
only reads and does not modify any data from the model.
Such commands will not call `CommandHistory#addToCommandHistory()`,
`CommandHistory#performUndo()`, `CommandHistory#performRedo()`.

Thus, the undo and redo stacks remain unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `newappt ...` to schedule a new appointment for a patient.
This action invokes `CommandHistory#addToCommandHistory()`, pushing the new action pair command in the undo stack.
However, the commands in the `commandRedoHistory` stack will be purged.

We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `newpatient ... -name John Doe`​ command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Pair Individual commands with their inverse action.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*|
1. Use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
|*Cons*|
1. Must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
2. Must ensure that commands are paired
|===

* *Alternative 3:* Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.

+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*|
1. Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
|*Cons*|
1. Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.

+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*|
1. We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
|*Cons*|
1. Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// end::undoredo[]

// end::reactivesearch[]
// tag::reactivesearchIntro[]

=== Reactive Search

The main concept behind reactive searching is to provide feedback to the user of their search results for
a given keyword as they type. However, filtering larger data sets may be a time consuming process.
Hence, the queries are processed on a separate thread to avoid blocking the `UI` thread.

// end::reactivesearchIntro[]

This is achieved in two phases:

==== Phase 1: UI invoking a Reactive Search Request

Similar to eager evaluation, Reactive Search attempts to process commands if it does not mutate the storage. Otherwise it does a simple redirect to the tab relevant to the command.

image::ReactiveSearchSequenceDiagram.png[]

After which, changes to the ObservableList will trigger the updateItem listener in UI. And since each graphical update is fast and can only be executed from the JavaFX main application thread, we defer each of them via Platform.run() so that the FX main application thread can execute them in order whenever it is free.

[source, java]
----
class EventListViewCell extends ListCell<Event> {
    @Override
    protected void updateItem(Event event, boolean empty) {
        super.updateItem(event, empty);

        if (empty || event == null) {
            Platform.runLater(() -> setGraphic(null));
        } else {
            Platform.runLater(() -> setGraphic(new EventCard(event, getIndex() + 1, displayStatus).getRoot()));
        }
    }
}
----

Hence, this ensures the main FX application thread is always polling for user inputs or graphical updates and handles them rapidly as they are lightweight tasks.


==== Phase 2: Multi-threading and synchronisation of Reactive Search requests

// tag::reactivesearchthreading[]

If the `UI` triggers another reactive search request before previous request is completed,
the thread of the previous request is first interrupted and joined to the thread of the new request.
Only after the previous thread has been successfully interrupted, the new request will be processed.
This is done to ensure that the UI thread only displays the results of the latest request.

.Sequence Diagram showing how the multi-threading is handled.

// end::reactivesearchthreading[]

// end::reactivesearch[]

// tag::autocomplete[]

=== AutoComplete

We are using Prefix Tree which is known as a Trie for AutoComplete. This gives us a worst case time complexity of O(m), where m is length of the search string. While the space complexity is O(bm), where b is number of unique characters used, m is length of longest word stored.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*|
1. Search Time Complexity Efficient: O(m), where m is length of searched word. +
2. One of the most natural data structure for text prediction.
|*Cons*|
1. Requires initialisation. +
2. Requires rebuilding of strings.
|===

* *Alternative 2:* Using ArrayList.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*|
1. Extremely simple to implement.
|*Cons*|
1. Search Time Complexity Inefficient: O(nm), where n is number of words and m is length of searched word.
|===

// end::autocomplete[]

// tag::queue[]
=== Queue feature
The queue feature allows the user to enqueue and dequeue a patient from the queue.

* e.g. `enqueue 003A` - Enqueues the patient with `referenceId` 003A.
* e.g. `next 1` Serves the next patient in queue and allocates him/her to room 1.

Queue supports a few basic commands:

* Enqueue -- Enqueues a patient into the queue. +
Format: `enqueue <PATIENT_REFERENCE_ID>`
* Dequeue -- Dequeues a patient from the queue. +
Format: `dequeue <QUEUE_INDEX>`
* Next -- Assigns the next patient in the queue to a doctor. +
Format: `next <ENTRY_ID>`
* Break -- Avoids directing patients to a doctor. e.g. Doctor is on a lunch break +
Format: `break <ENTRY_ID>`
* Resume -- Allows patients to be directed to a doctor. e.g. Doctor is back from his/her break. +
Format: `resume <ENTRY_ID>`

==== Current Implementation
The queue will be displayed in a list.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an enqueue command:

.Enqueue Activity Diagram
image::EnqueueActivityDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a next command:

.Next Activity Diagram
image::NextActivityDiagram.png[]

Below is an example usage of the queue feature.

Step 1: User enters the `enqueue E0000001A` command.

Step 2: The command then calls Model#enqueuePatient to enqueue the patient into the queue.

Step 3: Patient will then displayed in the queue.

// end::queue[]

// tag::appointment[]
=== Appointment feature

The Appointment feature enables users to manage appointments for patients by providing basic Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) of appointments. User is also able to find missed appointments and settle each missed appointment efficiently.

* e.g. `newappt -id E0000001A -start 01/12/19 0900 -end 01/12/19 0940 -reoccur m -num 2` - creates two monthly reoccurring appointments to patient whose `referenceId` is E0000001A.
* e.g. `editappt -entry 1 -start 01/12/19 1000 -end 01/12/19 1040` - edits a patient's first appointment timing to be the input timing if there is no conflict with doctor's duty shift.



The number of scheduled appointments cannot be more than the number of on-duty staff doctors at any given time.

==== Current Implementation
The current appointment feature is implemented using a list which works like a balanced binary search tree. This allows us to search for an appointment within O(logn) instead of O(n) time, where n is the number of appointments in the list.

The Appointment feature contains multiple operations to indirectly manipulate the `UniqueEventList`. The implemented operations include:

`newappt` Command - Creates an new appointment or reoccurring appointments for a patient.

`ackappt` Command - Acknowledges an appointment whenever the patient checks in with the clerk.

`appointments` Command - Lists all upcoming appointments or appointments which involves the patient whose referenceId contains a certain keyword.

`editappt` Command - Edits an appointment timing.

`cancelappt` Command - Cancels an appointment.

`missappt` Command - Lists all missed appointments.

`settleappt` Command - Removes a missed appointment.

The appointment class diagram below illustrates the interactions between the Appointment class and associated classes.

.Appointment class diagram
image::AppointmentClassDiagram.png[]

he appointment will be rejected by the system, if there are insufficient staff doctors on duty at the time of the appointment. +
Each `Appointment` object consists of a `PersonReferenceId`, `Timing`, `Status`. `Timing` class has 2 `DateTime` objects which indicates the start and end time of the `appointment`. The `UniqueEventList` contains 0 or more appointments.

The current implementation of `Appointment` checks with `patient` object by the unique `referenceId` and also checks the timing with doctors' dutyRoster. If the `referenceId` exists within the Model#UniquePersonList and the timing is valid, then the `Appointment` object is constructed. This ensures that the patient is registered before making any appointments and the appointment's timing is valid.

The appointment will be rejected by the system, if there are insufficient staff doctors on duty at the time of the appointment. +

Before an appointment can be scheduled, the system first checks the total number of staff doctors on duty in that timeslot. Next, the system checks the existing appointments in that timeslot. If the number of appointments in that timeslot is less than the number of doctors, the appointment will be scheduled. Otherwise, the appointment will not be scheduled.

==== `newappt` Command
The `newappt` command is similar to the `new` command of patient and doctor. The command takes in the parameters required to construct `ReferenceId`, `DateTime` and `Status`. The image below shows how the `Appointment` object is constructed.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `AddAppointment` command:

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component when a user executes a `newappt` command
image::AddAppointmentActivityDiagram.png[]

==== `ackappt` command

The `ackappt` command marks the patient's the most upcoming appointment as acknowledged only if it is on the same day and it is before the appointment's end time and also updates `UniqueEventList` to display the rest appointments belonging to the patient.

==== `appointments` Command

The `appointments` command works in two different ways.

Case 1: `appointments referenceId`

The `appointments` command searches for appointments that belong to the patient based on the given `referenceId`. The filtered appointments are found in `ModelManager`. The list is instantiated by filtering the `UniqueEventList` using `EventContainsKeywordPredicate` which is created from the `ReferenceId` argument supplied by the user.

Case 2: `appointments`

If the `appointments` command is executed without any other arguments, it executes with the predicate `EventContainsApprovedStatusPredicate`. updateFilteredAppointmentList() is called and the entire list of upcoming appointments is shown to the user.

==== `editappt` Command
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `editappt` command:

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component when a user executes a `editappt` command

image::ChangeAppointmentActivityDiagram.png[]

==== `cancelappt` Command

`cancelappt` simply takes in the index of the target appointment to cancel according to the displayed appointment list.

Given below is the sequence diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("cancelappt 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `cancelappt 1` Command
image::CancelAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== `missappt` Command

The `missappt` command displays appointments that patients did not attend. The filtered appointments are found in `ModelManager`. The list is instantiated by filtering the `UniqueEventList` using `EventsMissedPredicate` which checks all APPROVED-Status appointments' end times with current time.

==== `settleappt` Command

The `settleappt` command helps users to remove any missed appointments once users have settled it. It will also update `UniqueEventList` to display the rest of the missed appointments.

In future implementations, i.e. v2.0, the valid timing slot will be given based on the doctor's availability. This ensures users can easily choose a slot to arrange appointments for patients.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect:  How to store Timing fields

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create `DateTime` and `Timing` class to store
** Pros: Makes it easier to calculate timings and clashes between multiple appointments with different timing field.
** Cons: Requires additional code to implement Timing class and interact with other common methods that rely on DateTime.
* **Alternative 2:** Store as Strings
** Pros: Makes it easier to implement.
** Cons: Requires additional code to convert into `DateTime` class when carrying out calculating methods.

===== Aspect: display appointments

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display appointments in a tab
** Pros: Creates an intuitive and easily navigable screen to display appointments.
** Cons: Decreases the efficiency of CLI by having to use GUI inputs.
* **Alternative 2:** Keeps the onscreen clutter at a minimum and stays in line with the CLI concept.
** Pros: Makes it easier to implement.
** Cons: Increases difficulty in freely accessing appointments.
// end::appointment[]

// tag::shift[]
=== Duty Shift Scheduling

The duty shift scheduling provides users the ability to schedule duty shifts for doctors. It can help doctors to check, add, edit duty shifts efficiently.

* e.g. `newshift -id W0000001A -start 01/11/19 0900 -end 01/12/19 2100 -reoccur m -num 2` - allows the user to create two monthly reoccurring duty shifts to doctor whose `referenceId` is W0000001A.
* e.g. `editshift -entry 1 -start 02/12/19 0900 -end 02/12/19 2100` - allows the user to change a doctor's first duty shift to be the input timing if there is no conflict with appointments.

==== Current Implementation
The duty shift scheduling contains multiple operations to indirectly manipulate the `UniqueEventList`. The implemented operations include:

`newshift` Command - Adds a duty shift or reoccurring duty shifts to a doctor.

`shifts` Command - Lists all duty shifts involving the doctor's referenceId which contains the keyword.

`editshift` Command - Change a current duty shift's timing.

`cancelshift` Command - Cancels duty shift.

Each Duty Shift is an `Event` object consists of a `PersonReferenceId`, `Timing`, `Status`. `Timing` class has 2 `DateTime` object as they indicate the start and end times of the duty shift.

The current implementation of duty shift checks with doctor object by the unique `referenceId` and also checks the timing with appointments. If the `referenceId` exists within the Model#UniquePersonList and the timing is valid, then the duty shift is constructed. This ensures that the doctor is registered and the duty shift's timing is valid before making any duty shifts.

The duty  shift will be rejected by the system, if there are insufficient staff doctors on duty at the given time. +

Before a duty shift's time can be edited, the system first checks the total number of staff doctors on duty in that timeslot. Next, the system checks the existing appointments in that timeslot. If the number of appointments in that timeslot is less than the number of doctors, the duty shift's time will be changed. Otherwise, the duty shift will not be allowed to edit.

==== `newshift` Command
The `newshift` command behaves similarly to the `new` command used for patient and doctor. The command takes in the parameters required to construct `ReferenceId`, `DateTime` and `Status`.

==== `shifts` Command

The `shifts` command works in two different ways.

Case 1: `shifts ReferenceId`

The shifts command searches for duty shifts that belong to the doctor based on the given `ReferenceId`. The filtered shifts are found in `ModelManager`. The list is instantiated by filtering the `UniqueEventList` using `EventContainsKeywordPredicate` which is created from the `referenceId` argument supplied by the user.

Case 2: `shifts`

The shifts behaves similarly to `shifts ReferenceId` when it does not take in any other arguments. Instead, it automatically executes with the predicate `EventContainsApprovedStatusPredicate`. updateFilteredEventList() is called and the entire list of the upcoming duty shifts is shown to the user.

==== `editshift` Command
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `editshift` command:

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component when a user executes a `editshift` command

image::ChangeShiftActivityDiagram.png[]

==== `cancelshift` Command

`cancelshift` simply takes in the index of the target duty shift to cancel according to the displayed shift list.

// end::shift[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained. If window settings under `preferences.json` is corrupted and becomes reasonably small or large, the default size of 800x600 will be used instead.

=== Editing a patient

. Editing a patient while certain patient(s) have been searched.

.. Prerequisites: Search for an interested person via `patient [<SEARCH_KEYWORD>]` then press kbd:[ENTER].
.. Test case: `editpatient -entry 1 -name test` +
   Expected: All patients will be listed again with the particular patient of index found after searching has his or her name modified to `test`.

=== Saving data

. Dealing with missed/corrupted data files

.. Prerequisites: Removing or Modifying files in data folder residing in same directory as `ClerkPro.jar`.
.. Test case: Deleting the entire data folder. +
   Expected: ClerkPro will attempt to access the folder. If it does not exists, the data folder will be automatically created with default settings. Other jsons beside `preferences.json` will be created upon modification of sample data loaded.
.. Test case: Corrupting data files by modifying its entries. +
   Expected: ClerkPro will try its best to parse the data. If it is not valid, it must be corrupted. Therefore the application will load up with default settings and sample data.

=== Navigating in UI

. Navigating with keyboard only

.. Test case: kbd:[TAB] key should change focus from the upper panels to Command Box and Command Box to Tab Bar. +
   Expected: When TabBar or Command Box is in focus, there should exist an indication of turquoise/blue border.
.. Test case: Both kbd:[UP] and kbd:[DOWN] keys should also work even if the selected item is of the first or last index. +
   Expected: When UP is pressed during a selected item in the list view or Tab Bar is of first index, it should brings the selection to the last index of the list view or Tab Bar. Vice versa for the last index when selected.

=== Command Box

. AutoComplete

.. Test case: *Any partial commands with leading spaces. +
   Expected: AutoComplete appears in an aligned overlay showing available commands for whatever has been typed.
.. Test case: `newpatient -id` with any number of leading spaces but at least one ending space(s). +
   Expected: AutoComplete does not suggest any other flags because its previous word is in a flag format.
.. Test case: `newpatient -id Mo-name` with any number of leading spaces but at least one ending space(s). +
   Expected: Since `Mo-name` is not a flag, AutoComplete should suggest all unused flags but not `-id`.
.. Test case: Lengthy Command in Command Box reaching the right-most end of the Command Box. +
   Expected: AutoComplete will display all suggestions visibly at the right-most end but will lose the perfect alignment since its impossible to align any further while staying visible to the user.
.. Test case: kbd:[UP] & kbd:[DOWN] & kbd:[ENTER] while focus is still on the Command Box. +
   Expected: The selection should change according to kbd:[UP] & kbd:[DOWN]. While kbd:[ENTER] should set the selected tag into the Command Box, instead of executing the unfinished Command.

. History

.. Prerequisites:
1. Some commands that has been entered regardless if it is invalid or valid.
2. Command Box is focused.
3. AutoComplete is not in action.
.. Test case: Press kbd:[UP] then kbd:[DOWN] +
   Expected: Upon kbd:[UP], current text in Command Box is replaced with previously entered command. Then after, pressing kbd:[DOWN] displays an empty command box since the last text that was in the Command Box is not entered and thus not part of history.
